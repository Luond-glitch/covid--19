# COVID-19 Global Data Tracker

This project is a data analysis notebook developed as part of the Python Development Module. It provides a global overview of the COVID-19 pandemic, including continent-level statistics and time-series trends for selected countries.

## 📌 Project Objectives

- Analyze and visualize global COVID-19 data using Python.
- Present trends in total cases and deaths by continent.
- Track daily new cases over time.
- Visualize country-specific COVID-19 trends (e.g., Kenya).
- Practice using Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for real-world data analysis.

## 🧰 Tools and Libraries Used

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation and analysis
- **Matplotlib** – Visualization
- **Seaborn** – Statistical graphics
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Interactive analysis

## 📁 Data Source

The dataset is sourced from [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/coronavirus-source-data), specifically:
- **CSV file**: `https://covid.ourworldindata.org/data/owid-covid-data.csv`

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Ensure the required Python libraries are installed:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
🔍 Key Insights
Europe and Asia recorded the highest cumulative cases.

Africa, while less affected in totals, showed regional spikes.

Kenya experienced visible waves, especially in 2021.

Real-world datasets often require cleaning and filtering for analysis.
